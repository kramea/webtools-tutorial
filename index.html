These are some of the fundamentals to help introduce you to the syntaxes (syntacti?) of HTML & CSS. The goal is to just barely get your feet wet and, hopefully, get you hungry to do more!
These are not a comprehensive guide to all things HTML & CSS. You will have questions. That's ok. A big part of all kinds of coding is taking what you do know and building upon it. That often means research and collaborating with others. Thankfully, there are a plethora of resources on the internet

##Task 1b - Chrome Developer Tools

- Open tab where you are running this slideshow

- Press Ctrl+Shift+I (or F12) to open developer tools

- Check out the different panels. More info on them [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)

- In Console panel type:
```javascript
console.log('Hello World')
```

##Task 2 - Quick Review of Client & Server

![](img/client-server.gif)

Open Network Panel on Developer Tools, Reload the page

When a link is clicked, the browser creates an .em[HTTP Get Request] that is sent to the server.

Server responds. Browser displays the page. Sees that it needs a few more things - e.g. images, fonts, other files.

Browser sends new a GET request for each item. Server sends response for each request with status code (200 - found, 304 - retrieving from browser cache, 404 - not found, 500 - server error )

##Task 3a - HTML

- Hyper Text Markup Language

- Describes content (not presentation)

- Tags, elements, attributes

- Open [_html.html](exercises/_html.html) in a new tab

- Exercise: Create an ordered list in the body

???
Code Executed on your computer - 3 different peices. HTML, CSS and JS. HTML answers the what, content. Bunch of abbreviations, just memorize. Never see what's in the head. Head is the metadata. Title. Not displayed on the page. English document encoded this way. Apply these styles.

##Task 3b - CSS

- HTML is content, CSS is the style, the presentation of the content. 

- Collection of rules dictates how HTML looks.

- Cascading -> style properties cascade down through all child elements

- Open [_css.html](exercises/_css.html) in a new tab

##Task 2b - CSS Resources

CSS, like HTML, has a lot of stuff to it. It’s impossible to keep it all in your head. Don’t expect to memorize all of it. Use sites like the MDN, CSS-Tricks, and Stack Overflow when you need help.

##JSON

- [JavaScript Object Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

- Lightweight data-interchange format, language independent

- Attribute value pairs


???
JJavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.

Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages.

name: geojson


##GeoJSON

- [Encodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) collections of simple geographical features along with their non-spatial attributes using JSON

- Open standard, maintained by working group of developers

- [TopoJSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#TopoJSON)

- QGIS, geojson.io, [validate your geojson](http://geojsonlint.com/), [mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org/)


???
GeoJSON[1] is an open standard format for encoding collections of simple geographical features along with their non-spatial attributes using JavaScript Object Notation. The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types. GeoJSON features need not represent entities of the physical world only; mobile routing and navigation apps, for example, might describe their service coverage using GeoJSON.[2]

The GeoJSON format differs from other GIS standards in that it was written and is maintained not by a formal standards organization, but by an Internet working group of developers.[3]

A notable offspring of GeoJSON is TopoJSON, an extension of GeoJSON that encodes geospatial topology and that typically provides smaller file sizes.
