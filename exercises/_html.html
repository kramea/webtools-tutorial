			<!-- Exercise 3: Add class to blog title -->
			<h2>Title of my latest post</h2>
			<p>This is a regular paragraph. There is not too much else to say about it, <em>except this important thing</em>, just to fill some space. With more words here, you will be able to see how the text wraps around once it hits the right edge of the window.</p>

			<p>Here is what I'd <em>really</em> like to do next (just so I don't forget):</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Make a list of items</li>
				<li>Do all the things on the list</li>
				<li>Check them off as I go</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<!-- Exercise 3: Add class to blog title -->
			<h2>Title of my previous post</h2>
			<p>This is where you start Exercise 3.</p>
			<p>Put your ordered list below this paragraph:</p>
			<!-- Exercise 3: Add ordered list here -->
